## Description
- A simple quiz application where the user is asked one question at a time and must select and answer from the multiple choices that are given.
- Whenever the user taps on the wrong answer choice, the button will shake to let the user know that he/she has selected the wrong answer. On the other hand, if the user selected the correct answer, the button's background will turn green and a new button will appear to let the user go to the next question.
